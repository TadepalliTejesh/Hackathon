    <h2>6.1 Introduction to the NASA PACE Satellite</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite is a next-generation NASA Earth-observing mission designed to study our planet's oceans, atmosphere, and ecosystems in unprecedented detail.
        <li>It plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of climate change, ocean health, air quality, and the intricate interactions between the ocean and atmosphere.
        
    </ul>
    <h2>6.2.Key Instruments on PACE</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>PACE will carry three main instruments that enable it to collect comprehensive data on ocean color, aerosols, and clouds.</li>
        <li>These instruments are designed to capture measurements across a broad range of wavelengths, making PACE one of the most advanced Earth-observing satellites ever deployed.</li>
             <ul>   <li style="list-style-type:square;">Ocean Color Instrument (OCI)</li>

    <img src="OCI-1.jpg" alt="OCI">
      <ul>
        <li> PACE's primary sensor, the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), is a highly advanced optical spectrometer that will be used to measure properties of light over portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.     
        </li>
        <li>It will enable continuous measurement of light at finer wavelength resolution than previous NASA satellite sensors, extending key system ocean color data records for climate studies.   
        </li>
        <li>The color of the ocean is determined by the interaction of sunlight with substances or particles present in seawater such as chlorophyll, a green pigment found in most phytoplankton species.
        </li>
        <li>By monitoring global phytoplankton distribution and abundance with unprecedented detail, the OCI will help us to better understand the complex systems that drive ocean ecology.
