    <h2>6.1 Introduction to the NASA PACE Satellite</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite is a next-generation NASA Earth-observing mission designed to study our planet’s oceans, atmosphere, and ecosystems in unprecedented detail.
        <li>It plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of climate change, ocean health, air quality, and the intricate interactions between the ocean and atmosphere.
        
    </ul>
    <h2>6.2.Key Instruments on PACE</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>PACE will carry three main instruments that enable it to collect comprehensive data on ocean color, aerosols, and clouds.</li>
        <li>These instruments are designed to capture measurements across a broad range of wavelengths, making PACE one of the most advanced Earth-observing satellites ever deployed.</li>
             <ul>   <li style="list-style-type:square;">Ocean Color Instrument (OCI)</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type:square;">Spectro-Polarimeter for Planetary Exploration (SPEXone)</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type:square;">Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter-2 (HARP2)</li>
             </ul> 
    </ul>  
    <h3>6.21. Ocean Color Instrument (OCI)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> PACE's primary sensor, the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), is a highly advanced optical spectrometer that will be used to measure properties of light over portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. </li>
        <li>It will enable continuous measurement of light at finer wavelength resolution than previous NASA satellite sensors, extending key system ocean color data records for climate studies.</li>
        <li>The color of the ocean is determined by the interaction of sunlight with substances or particles present in seawater such as chlorophyll, a green pigment found in most phytoplankton species.</li>
        <li>By monitoring global phytoplankton distribution and abundance with unprecedented detail, the OCI will help us to better understand the complex systems that drive ocean ecology.</li>

      </ul>  
    <ul>
        <li>OCI Overview</li>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type:square;"><b>Mass :</b> 272 kg (600 lb), current best estimate.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square;"><b>Power :</b> 237 W, current best estimate.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square;"><b>Volume :</b> 229.3 cm x 131.1 cm x 130.6 cm (90.3 in x 51.6 in x 51.4 in) </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square;"><b>Field of Regard :</b>−56.0° to +56.5°, swath width of ~2700 km.<br>[Field of Regard (FOR) refers to the entire area or swath of the Earth's surface that a satellite sensor or instrument can potentially observe] </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square;"><b>Coverage :</b>2-day global coverage at 1.2 km (0.75 mi) resolution. <br>[Coverage refers to the geographical area that a satellite can observe or collect data from as it orbits the Earth. ] </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square;"><b>Along-track tilt : </b>19.9°, aft in the southern hemisphere, fore in the northern hemisphere.<br>[Along-Track Tilt refers to the capability of a satellite to tilt its instruments forward or backward along the direction of its orbit (also known as the "track"). <br>This feature allows the satellite to adjust the angle at which it captures images or data, which can enhance its observational capabilities and expand its coverage.]</li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square;"><b>Ultraviolet-to-Near-infrared Spectral Range : </b>Hyperspectral radiometry from the ultraviolet (340 nm) to near-infrared (895 nm). Bandwidth at 5 nm resolution and spectral steps of 2.5 nm (with spectral steps of 1.25 nm in a limited number of wavelength ranges). Radiances from 315 nm to 340 nm will also be provided, but the radiometric accuracy for those bands is degraded significantly</li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square;"><b>SWIR Bands :</b> 940, 1038, 1250, 1378, 1615, 2130, and 2260 nm.<br>[SWIR Bands (Shortwave Infrared bands) refer to a range of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum typically between 1,100 nm and 2,500 nm (or 1.1 to 2.5 micrometers). ]</li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square;"><b>Calibration :</b> Refers to the process of ensuring that the instruments onboard the satellite provide accurate and consistent measurements over time. <br>Total calibration of instrument artifacts less than 0.5% for most bands at top-of-atmosphere.<br> Daily and monthly solar calibrations using two onboard solar diffusers. Bi-monthly lunar calibrations. Monthly linearity measurements with a dim solar diffuser.</li>

        <li>Construction of OCI</li>
        <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type:square;">The OCI was built at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). It consists of a cross-track rotating telescope, thermal radiators, along with half-angle mirror and solar calibration mechanisms.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type:square;">The OCI's tilt will help avoid sun glint and single science detector design will inhibit image striping. Its signal-to-noise ratios will rival or exceed previous ocean color instruments</li>
        </ul>
